## Before Contributing
Be sure that you are aware of our license, code and GitHub conventions and our git workflow before contributing to Wedium.

## Setup Guide
### Prerequisites
We recommend the usage of Visual Studio for the development of the backend and your choice of text editor for the frontend.

* Ensure you have installed the `.NET Core 3.1` SDK.
    * If using Visual Studio, also ensure the `ASP.NET and Web Development Tools` package is installed.
* Ensure `NPM / NodeJS` is installed to run the frontend.

### Setup Steps
1. Find and open `WediumBackend.sln` in `./WediumBackend`.
2. Add the `WediumDatabase` connection string and `JwtSecret` into `appsettings.json` _(contact a team-member to obtain values)_.
3. Build the project and launch `WediumAPI` in Visual Studio. This will install the necessary NuGet packages and launch IISExpress. 
4. Naviagate to the frontend folder in `./WediumFrontend` in a command line tool.
5. Run `npm install` in the command line tool to download and install frontend dependencies.
6. Create a `.env.development` file in `./WediumFrontend`. Add the `REACT_APP_API_URL` and `REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` settings to the file _(contact a team-member to obtain values)_.
7. Run `npm start` in the command line tool to start the React development server.
8. The default internet browser will redirect to the home page (`http://localhost:3000/`). This should be successfully connected to the backend.
